## Exercise 10A Reference

[R for Geospatial Data Science and Analytics - 17Â  Modelling Geographical Accessibility](https://r4gdsa.netlify.app/chap17.html)

## Overview

In this exercise, we will learn to model geographical accessibility using Hansen's potential model, Spatial Accessibility Measure (SAM), and other methods in R.

## Learning Outcome

- Import GIS polygon data into R and save them as a simple feature data frame using the **sf** package.
- Import aspatial data into R and save them as a simple feature data frame using the **sf** package.
- Compute accessibility measures using Hansen's potential model and Spatial Accessibility Measure (SAM).
- Visualize the accessibility measures using **tmap** and **ggplot2** packages.

## The Data

The following datasets will be used in this exercise:

| **Data Set**              | **Description**                                                                                                      | **Format**              |
|---------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|
| `MP14_SUBZONE_NO_SEA_PL`  | URA Master Plan 2014 subzone boundary GIS data.                                                                      | ESRI Shapefile          |
| `hexagons`                | A 250m radius hexagons GIS data created using the `st_make_grid()` function of the **sf** package.                    | ESRI Shapefile          |
| `ELDERCARE`               | GIS data showing the location of eldercare services, available in both ESRI shapefile and Google KML format.           | ESRI Shapefile          |
| `OD_Matrix`               | A distance matrix with origin-destination information, including entry, network, and exit costs.                      | CSV                     |

## Installing and Launching the R Packages

The following R packages will be used in this exercise:

| **Package**       | **Purpose**                                                                                              | **Use Case in Exercise**                                                                                       |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **sf**            | Handles spatial data; imports, manages, and processes vector-based geospatial data.                                                           | Importing and transforming geospatial datasets such as subzone boundaries, hexagons, and eldercare locations.   |
| **SpatialAcc**    | Provides functions for computing geographical accessibility measures.                                                                          | Calculating Hansen's potential model, Spatial Accessibility Measure (SAM), and other accessibility metrics.     |
| **tidyverse**     | A collection of R packages for data science tasks like data manipulation, visualization, and modeling.                                         | Wrangling and visualizing data, including importing CSV files and performing data transformations.              |
| **tmap**          | Creates static and interactive thematic maps using cartographic quality elements.                                                              | Visualizing accessibility measures on thematic maps.                                                           |
| **ggplot2**       | Creates data visualizations using a layered grammar of graphics.                                                                               | Visualizing statistical graphics such as histograms and boxplots of accessibility measures.                    |
| **ggstatsplot**   | Enhances plots with statistical details and facilitates data visualization.                                                                    | Creating statistically enriched plots for exploratory data analysis and comparing distributions.                |

It encompasses everything from freight shipments, energy flows, and the global trade in rare antiquities, to flight schedules, rush hour woes, and pedestrian foot traffic.\n\n> An OD matrix, or spatial interaction matrix, represents each spatial interaction as a discrete origin/destination pair, where each pair corresponds to a cell in the matrix; the rows denote the locations (centroids) of origin, and the columns represent the locations (centroids) of destination.\n\n\n## Learning Outcome\n\n- Import and extract OD data for a selected time interval.\n- Import and save geospatial data (bus stops and planning subzones) into sf tibble data frame objects.\n- Populate planning subzone codes into bus stops sf tibble data frames.\n- Construct desire lines geospatial data from the OD data.\n- Visualize passenger volume by origin and destination bus stops using the desire lines data.\n\n## The Data\n\nThe following datasets will be used in this exercise:\n\n| **Data Set**                              | **Description**                                                                                 | **Format**       |\n|--------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------|\n| Passenger Volume by Origin Destination Bus Stops | OD data set representing the volume of passengers traveling between bus stops.                       | CSV              |\n| BusStop                                    | Geospatial data providing the locations of bus stops as of the last quarter of 2022.               | ESRI Shapefile   |\n| MPSZ-2019                                   | Geospatial data providing the sub-zone boundary of the URA Master Plan 2019.                       | ESRI Shapefile   |\n\n\n## Installing and Launching the R Packages\n\nThe following R packages will be used in this exercise:\n\n| **Package**   | **Purpose**                                                                                                | **Use Case in Exercise**                                                                                  |\n|---------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **sf**        | Handles vector-based geospatial data.                                                                       | Importing, processing, and transforming geospatial data, such as bus stop locations and sub-zone boundaries. |\n| **tidyverse** | A collection of packages for data science tasks such as data manipulation, visualization, and modeling.     | Importing and wrangling OD and geospatial data, and visualizing analysis outputs.                           |\n| **tmap**      | Creates static and interactive thematic maps using cartographic quality elements.                           | Visualizing passenger flows and geographic clusters in a cartographic format.                               |\n| **stplanr**   | Provides functions for transport planning and modeling.                                                     | Creating geographic desire lines from OD data and solving transport-related problems.                      |\n| **DT**        | Provides an R interface to the JavaScript library DataTables for interactive table display.                 | Displaying data tables in an interactive format within the HTML output.                                     |\n\nTo install and load these packages, use the following code:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npacman::p_load(tmap, sf, DT, stplanr, tidyverse)\n```\n:::\n",
